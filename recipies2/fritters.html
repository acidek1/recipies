    <h1>Crispy broccoli parmesan fritters</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Crispy broccoli parmesan fritters. this is where i feel like inserting an evil laugh. 
<br>This week, i had a house full of kids and fed them fritters of all sorts – 
<br>without any of them realising the audacity i was committing by feeding them vegetables. without their knowledge or consent.
<br>to trick them, we just called them ‘shrek pancakes.’ do i insert evil laugh now?</p>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <li>1 large , fresh broccoli</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 an onion</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>1/3 cup shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/3 cup flour (or almond flour for a lower carb option)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>Olive oil cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Steps:</h2>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400°F | 200°C. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
    <li>Chop the broccoli into florets. Discard the hard part off of the stem, and chop the stem also. 
        <br>Place the broccoli and stem pieces into a food processor and pulse a few times until the broccoli is chopped. 
        <br>Add in the eggs, onion, garlic, flour and Parmesan. 
        <br>Pulse again a couple of times until well combined (about 5 seconds of pulsing). Stir the salt and pepper through the mixture.</li>
    <li>Form 8-10 fritters on the prepared baking sheets, making sure they 
        <br>don’t touch each other. Spray with a light coating of olive oil spray.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes on each side until golden.</li>
    <li>Alternatively pan fry in a nonstick pan over medium heat until golden on both sides.</li>
    <li>Allow fritters to cool slightly before serving. Serve with ketchup, Greek yogurt or fat free sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
