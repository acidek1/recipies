    <h1>Creamy mashed potatoes</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>With a table full of food, the most loved and devoured foods are side dishes.
    <br>Specifically, these Easy Creamy Mashed Potatoes.
    <br>The secret to this mash though is not an abundance of butter, but SOUR CREAM! Half butter,
    <br>a good amount of sour cream and HOT MILK make the most perfect and best Creamy Mashed Potatoes!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>2 pounds (1kg) potatoes, (Russet, Yukon Gold, Dutch Creams, Creme Gold, Creme Royale)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup hot milk, or more</li>
    <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened (close to room temp is best)</li>
    <li>6-8 cloves fresh garlic finely chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sour cream (reduced fat)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh shredded parmesan cheese, optional</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley to garnish, optional to garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <li>Peel and cut potatoes into quarters lengthwise. Remove any spots, lumps or knots.</li>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot (6-quart) and cover with cold, salted water by an inch. 
            <br>Bring to a boil, reduce heat down to medium-low and allow to simmer until fork tender (about 15-20 minutes).</li>
        <li>When potatoes are just about done (nearly fork-tender), 
            <br>heat 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small pan over medium-high heat. 
            <br>Saut√© garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Drain cooked potatoes, add in the remaining butter, cooked garlic, hot milk and sour cream.</li>
        <li>Mash the potatoes with a potato masher until smooth, adding a little extra milk if needed. 
            <br>(OPTIONAL: Use a strong wooden spoon OR electric beaters to beat further until smooth. 
            <br>Be careful NOT to over beat or they will become gluey.)</li>
        <li>Add in the parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ol>
